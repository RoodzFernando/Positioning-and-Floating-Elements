                    <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with
                        a new son and a year’s
                        appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far
                        beyond the world of known
                        physics.

                        He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have
                        been created in the Big
                        Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A
                        potential hitch in the presumed
                        course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that
                        exerted a repulsive force, causing
                        the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.

                        If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from
                        pole to pole and not like a
                        jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
                        irregularities. Those particles were
                        not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.

                        “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box
                        around it.
                        On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the
                        beginning of the Big Bang, and
                        that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.

                        Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with telescopes
                        at the South Pole, a team of
                        astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected
                        ripples in the fabric of
                        space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being wrenched
                        violently apart when it was
                        roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the
                        long-sought smoking-gun evidence of
                        inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.</p>
